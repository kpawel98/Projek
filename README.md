# Project
The aim of the project is to conduct data exploratory analysis using Matplotlib and seaborn.
Classification of white wine into high and low quality.
Use of different classifier models to predict wine quality.
# About Data 
- fixed acidity: most acids involved with wine or fixed or nonvolatile

- volatile acidity: the amount of acetic acid in wine

- citric acid: found in small quantities, citric acid can add 'freshness' and flavor to wines

- residual sugar: the amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops

- chlorides: the amount of salt in the wine

- free sulfur dioxide: the free form of SO2 exists in equilibrium between molecular SO2 (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion

- total sulfur dioxide: amount of free and bound forms of S02

- density: the density of water is close to that of water depending on the percent alcohol and sugar content

- pH: describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic)

- sulphates: a wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas (S02) levels

- alcohol: the percent alcohol content of the wine Output Variable
